# File Metadata Microservice

A microservice that reads metadata of the uploaded file.

This project is my solution for [APIs and Microservices Projects - File Metadata Microservice] and it's a part of APIs and Microservices Certification by [freeCodeCamp].

## Requirements

✅ You can submit a form that includes a file upload.

✅ The form file input field has the `name` attribute set to `upfile`.

✅ When you submit a file, you receive the file `name`, `type`, and `size` in bytes within the JSON response.
